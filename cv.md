### Self-Introduction

I undertook my education with self-study through various online resources, such as YouTube.
My journey began with a focus on HTML and CSS, where I delved into the basics of web development.
After establishing a foundation, I ventured into JavaScript,
covering its syntax, methods, function, data types, and other fundamental concepts.
Currently, I am actively engaged in mastering React and Redux, and I have acquired proficiency in Redux Toolkit and Context API.
To showcase my progress and practical skills, I've worked on several projects that are available on my GitHub account
